# cryptoclustering

## Challenge Outputs
Exercise in further understanding Machine Learning Unsupervised Learning

Tools: sklearn, KMeans, Silhouette Scores, Scaling, Elbow Method, and PCA.

## Analysis
Based on our dataset of cryptocurreny market data, the <b>best number of clusters is 3</b> (when using scaling or PCA).

When viewing the composite plot side by side, the elbow curves visually resemble each other exactly. </br>
The Sihoulette Scores for the scaled data and PCA data listed 3 clusters as the best overall choice. </br>
The clustering graphs are different visually, showing the tighter cluster in the PCA data in comparison to the scaled data. The tight clusters give us confidence in the overall cluster number and data points.
